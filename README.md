Hi, I’m @JIWiggins. I graduated with an Honors English degree from Emory University in 2018. In 2020, I graduated with Distinction from the London School of Economics and Political Science with a Media and Communications degree, specializing in Data Science and Social Impact. At the LSE, I conducted research on racial representation in the gaming industry and video game journalism through NLP. A part of this research included investigating free expression and online safety as it relates to social media and digital policy. I am interested in applying a creative lens to solve complex data problems, specifically as they relate to human behavior. Particularly, I am interested in utilizing NLP techniques to uncover patterns and meaning in text data.
